This Project was made to enable Auto refreshing (mostly used on youtube to head music)
It was writen in HTML (without Javascript to make it more simple just replace ID with you Video id    
(e.g. from yt.com/watch?v=ejTgl3cCyDO itÂ´s ejTgl3cCyDO)   
and TIME with the amount of time you wanna head / see the video   
(e.g. the Video is 1 minute long then replace TIME with 60)
